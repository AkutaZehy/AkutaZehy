# Akuta Zehy

A beginner, continue learning...

A future testo engineer and game maker maybe.

My first being starred repository: [Free Snacks](https://github.com/AkutaZehy/free-snacks)

# Languages & Frameworks & Tools:

<details><summary>Expand/Collapse</summary>

## At the very first...

[![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-ED8B00.svg?logo=openjdk&logoColor=white)](#) 

<mark>is the best language in the world.</mark> The weird guy in the upper one is actually [OpenJDK](https://github.com/openjdk).

<s>What? Disagree? People like you should be sent to the [*Garbage Collector*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)). </s>

Learned Java as the first one, not a Java **master**.

[![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-%23ED8B00.svg?logo=coffeescript&logoColor=white)](#)

↑ By the way a better looking of Java Badge, using [coffeescript](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/), which is actually wrong in meaning. 

## Then...

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-14354C.svg?logo=python&logoColor=white)
![PyTorch](https://img.shields.io/badge/PyTorch-EE4C2C.svg?style=flat-square&logo=PyTorch&logoColor=white)
![OpenCV](https://img.shields.io/badge/opencv-%23white.svg?style=flat-square&logo=opencv&logoColor=white)
![nVIDIA](https://img.shields.io/badge/cuda-000000.svg?style=flat-square&logo=nVIDIA&logoColor=green)
[![Anaconda](https://img.shields.io/badge/Anaconda-44A833?logo=anaconda&logoColor=fff)](#)

<mark>Although I have studied and worked in deep learning so far, I do not plan to make it my main focus for future work. </mark>

One of the reasons is shown in this passage:

[Dear conda, drop DEAD](https://akutazehy.github.io/morsel/posts/conda%E4%BD%A0%E7%9C%9F%E7%9A%84%E5%8F%AF%E4%BB%A5%E5%8E%BB%E6%AD%BB%E4%BA%86/) (Written in Chinese)

Another reason is that I am extremely pessimistic about the development of AI in small companies. When you think about [FAIR](https://github.com/facebookresearch), a group training models with 100 [A100](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/) graphics cards in 2023, you know that unless you are a super genius, it is something you can never catch up with in your lifetime without *enough* money—I am not the kind, and the rest part, the part everyone could catch up, have long been devoured up by the market.

My Codes with Python on Deep Learning:

- [Crack Detection utils for Python](https://github.com/AkutaZehy/CrackDetection-Utils-for-Python) (archived)
- [GPSGaussian to Live](https://github.com/AkutaZehy/spaghetti/tree/main/gps_gaussian)
- [Multitask Maskformer](https://github.com/AkutaZehy/spaghetti/tree/main/Mask2Former-main)

**So, Python has been hidden from top langs below.**
